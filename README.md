# Capistrano Resque

Basic tasks for putting some Resque in your Cap.

### In your Gemfile:

```
gem "capistrano-resque", "~> 0.1.0", require: false
```

#### Capistrano 3.0

We are currently working to fully support Capistrano 3.0. Until an updated gem is released,
you can tell Bundler to use this GitHub repository:

```
gem "capistrano-resque", github: "sshingler/capistrano-resque", require: false
```

Please report any issues you run into using Capistrano 3.0.

### In your Capfile:

```
require "capistrano-resque"
```

Note: You must tell Bundler not to automatically require the file (by using `require: false`),
otherwise the gem will try to load the Capistrano tasks outside of the context of running
the `cap` command (e.g. running `rails console`).

### In your deploy.rb:

```
role :resque_worker, "app_domain"
role :resque_scheduler, "app_domain"

set :workers, { "my_queue_name" => 2 }

# Uncomment this line if your workers need access to the Rails environment:
# set :resque_environment_task, true
```

You can also specify multiple queues and the number of workers
for each queue:

```
set :workers, { "archive" => 1, "mailing" => 3, "search_index, cache_warming" => 1 }
```

The above will start five workers in total:

 * one listening on the `archive` queue
 * one listening on the `search_index, cache_warming` queue
 * three listening on the `mailing` queue

### Rails Environment

With Rails, Resque requires loading the Rails environment task to have access to your models, etc. (e.g. `QUEUE=* rake environment resque:work`). However, Resque is often used without Rails (and even if you are using Rails, you may not need/want to load the Rails environment). As such, the `environment` task is not automatically included.

If you would like to load the `environment` task automatically, add this to your `deploy.rb`:

```
set :resque_environment_task, true
``` 

### The tasks

Running cap -vT | grep resque should give you...

```
âž” cap -vT | grep resque
cap resque:status    # Check workers status
cap resque:start     # Start Resque workers
cap resque:stop      # Quit running Resque workers
cap resque:restart   # Restart running Resque workers
cap resque:scheduler:restart #
cap resque:scheduler:start   # Starts Resque Scheduler with default configs
cap resque:scheduler:stop    # Stops Resque Scheduler
```

### Restart on deployment

To restart you workers automatically when `cap deploy:restart` is executed
add the following line to your `deploy.rb`:

```
after "deploy:restart", "resque:restart"
```
### Logging

Backgrounding and logging are current sticking points. I'm using the HEAD of resque's 1-x-stable branch for the 0.0.8 release because it has some new logging functions not yet slated for a resque release.

In your Gemfile, you will need to specify:

```
gem 'resque', :git => 'git://github.com/resque/resque.git', :branch => '1-x-stable'
```

Also, you will need to include:

```
Resque.logger = Logger.new("new_resque_log_file")
```

...somewhere sensible, such as in your resque.rake, to achieve logging.

The chatter on: https://github.com/defunkt/resque/pull/450 gives more information. If using HEAD of this resque branch doesn't work for you, then pin to v0.0.7 of this project.

### Limitations

Starting workers is done concurrently via Capistrano and you are limited by ssh connections limit on your server (default limit is 10)

To to use more workers, please change your sshd configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config)
